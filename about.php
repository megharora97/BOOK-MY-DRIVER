                    <h3> BOOK MY DRIVER!!</h3>
                    <p>Book My Driver  is an indian multinational online transportation network company headquartered in india ,Faridabad. It develops, markets and operates the MyDriver app, which allows consumers with smartphones to submit a trip request which is then routed to drivers who use their own cars. As of April 12, 2016, the service was available in over 60 countries and 404 cities worldwide.Since its launch, several other companies have copied its business model, a trend that has come to be referred to as "driverification".
                    It's  pricing is similar to that of metered taxis, although all hiring and payment is handled exclusively through Mydriver and not with the driver personally. In some cities, if the car is travelling at a speed greater than 11 mph (18 km/h), the price is calculated on a distance basis; otherwise, the price is calculated on a time basis. At the end of a ride, the complete fare is automatically billed to the customer's credit card.MyDriver has said its prices are the premium that the customers pay for a cab service that is not only reliable, but also punctual and comfortable. It began allowing drivers to place signs in their windows stating that they can accept tips.The legality of MyDriver has been challenged by governments and taxi companies, who allege that its use of drivers who are not licensed to drive taxicabs is unsafe and illegal.
